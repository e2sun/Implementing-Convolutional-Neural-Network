# 🧠 Lab 7 – Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains the materials for **Lab 7**, where we implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch to perform image classification. The lab introduces concepts in deep learning and demonstrates how CNNs can be used to process and learn from visual data.
